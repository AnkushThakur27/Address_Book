# Implementing Advanced Features for Address Book in Java

User Story:
As a user of the Address Book application, I want to have more advanced features to enhance my experience and make the application more useful. This includes the ability to search for contacts, group contacts, and export/import the address book data.

Sprint 3 Tasks:

Implement Search Functionality:

Task: Create a search feature that allows users to search for contacts by their name or any other relevant attribute.
Acceptance Criteria: Users should be able to enter a search query and see a filtered list of contacts matching the search criteria.
Group Contacts:

Task: Implement the ability to group contacts together. A contact can belong to one or more groups.
Acceptance Criteria: Users should be able to create, edit, and delete groups. Contacts can be added or removed from groups.
Enhance User Interface for Contact Details:

Task: Improve the user interface for viewing and editing contact details. Add more fields if necessary (e.g., email, address, birthday).
Acceptance Criteria: Users should find it easy to view and edit detailed information about a contact. Include validation for contact details.
Sprint 4 Tasks:

Export/Import Functionality:

Task: Implement the ability to export the entire address book to a file (e.g., CSV) and import it back.
Acceptance Criteria: Users should be able to export their address book to a file and later import it, ensuring data integrity.
Implement Basic Sorting:

Task: Allow users to sort the list of contacts alphabetically by name.
Acceptance Criteria: Users should be able to toggle between ascending and descending order based on contact names.
Implement Pagination for Large Address Books:

Task: If the address book grows large, implement pagination to display a subset of contacts per page.
Acceptance Criteria: Users with a large number of contacts should experience improved performance and user interface responsiveness.
General Guidelines for the Junior Developer:

Follow best coding practices and maintain code readability.
Write unit tests to ensure the reliability of the implemented features.
Document the code and provide usage examples if needed.
Regularly communicate progress and any challenges faced during the implementation.
Seek feedback from the team to ensure the code aligns with the overall architecture and standards.
Note:
Ensure that the features are developed incrementally and can be demonstrated at the end of each sprint. Encourage the junior developer to ask questions and seek guidance when needed.
